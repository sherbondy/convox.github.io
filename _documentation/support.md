### Community Support

The Convox community has a [public Slack channel](https://convox-public.slack.com) ([request an invite](http://invite.convox.com/)). This is the best place to ask support questions.

Convox is an [open-source project on GitHub](https://github.com/convox). You can also report bugs via GitHub issues.

### Commercial Support
You can email [support@convox.com](mailto:support@convox.com) with technical support questions. We will get back to you during normal business hours.

Convox Support may benefit by you granting access to your AWS account. See [Creating a convox-support IAM User and Login](https://gist.github.com/nzoschke/c8217a31f58ceb9e0802) for instructions.
